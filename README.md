This is the beginning step in the path of understanding the rich and complex way of the APIs. But most of all... the NEW ways for this "code padawan".


Captain's log: APIs are, as I understand now, programms made for talking to programs. 
They are a city of computers talking to each other, whispering in the shadows and conjuring simple data that the front end needs to interact with the user
and then whispering back again to the database. Keeping Computer's City walls and streets steady and time proof.
